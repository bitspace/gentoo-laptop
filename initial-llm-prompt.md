I am building a Gentoo Linux system. I have the base system successfully installed so that I now have a laptop with Linux and a bash shell prompt and no GUI. Before installing the GUI, I would like to be certain that I have an otherwise working and secure system.

I am very experienced with Linux, having used it as my primary desktop operating system for over 30 years. I used Gentoo extensively for several years, but that was around 20 years ago.  

I am always trying to keep up to date with the latest versions of most software I use; I tend to spend my time on the bleeding edge. As such, I wish to use the testing branch of Gentoo and all installed software.

This is a list of my uses for the computer, in descending order of importance:

- Software development using a wide array of programming languages and frameworks, mostly Python, Rust, Java, JavaScript, some C, a little bit of C++, as well as scripting "languages" like bash, Perl, and Lua.
- Cloud Development with GCP and AWS; I may try to learn a bit about Azure too.
- AI and LLM's, especially in the nascent agentic/generative software development automation area. I am very excited by things like Claude Code, Google Gemini CLI, and OpenAI Codex, as well as the integration of the LLM capabilities in IDE's (JetBrains product stack and Visual Studio Code, primarily). MCP excites me too.
- Linux administration and possibly some light development of Linux software.
- Gaming via Steam, Proton, WINE, and other mechanisms. I have a moderately sized Steam library with a mix of Linux native ports of popular games and Windows games that run with Proton. I am partial to GloriousEggroll's versions of Proton.
- Music recording, especially electric and acoustic guitar, and some music production with MIDI. I would love to figure out a way to take advantage of my Native Instruments MIDI hardware (keyboards and drum machines).  

Please suggest some initial packages that I should install and any configuration and administration steps that I should take.

I am using [the Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Main_Page) for guidance, but I was hoping that I could use some LLM love to help distill all of that information into a task list.

I have completed all of the "Installing Gentoo" section of the Gentoo Handbook [here[(https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64) from a desktop/systemd profile.
