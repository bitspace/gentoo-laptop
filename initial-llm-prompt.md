# Initial LLM Prompt

I am building a Gentoo Linux system. I have the base system successfully installed so that I now have a laptop with Linux and a bash shell prompt and no GUI. Before installing the GUI, I would like to be certain that I have an otherwise working and secure system.

I am very experienced with Linux, having used it as my primary desktop operating system for over 30 years. I used Gentoo extensively for several years, but that was around 20 years ago.

This is a list of my uses for the computer, in descending order of importance:

- Software development using a wide array of programming languages and frameworks, mostly Python, Rust, Java, JavaScript, some C, a little bit of C++, as well as scripting "languages" like bash, Perl, and Lua.
- Cloud Development with GCP and AWS, and possibly with some Azure.
- AI and LLM's, especially in the nascent agentic/generative software development automation area. I am very excited by things like Claude Code and Google Gemini CLI, as well as the integration of the LLM capabilities in IDE's (JetBrains product stack and Visual Studio Code, primarily).
- Linux administration and possibly some light development of Linux software.
- Gaming via Steam, Proton, WINE, and other mechanisms.
- Music recording, especially electric and acoustic guitar, and some music production with MIDI.

Please suggest some initial packages that I should install and any configuration and administration steps that I should take.

I am using the Gentoo Wiki for guidance, but I was hoping that I could use some LLM love to help distill all of that information into a task list.

I have completed all of the "Installing Gentoo" section of the Gentoo Handbook here https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64 and have started along the "Working with Gentoo" and "Working with Portage" sections, but I can study those after I've got a working system.
