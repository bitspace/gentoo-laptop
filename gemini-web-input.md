# Gemini Response to Initial Prompt

## Model: 2.5 Flash

Greetings. It is good to see a seasoned Linux user returning to Gentoo. Your detailed use-case provides a solid foundation for tailoring a robust and secure system. Given your extensive experience, I will focus on the Gentoo-specific nuances and optimization strategies.

Before proceeding with a graphical environment, establishing a secure and functional base is paramount.

### Initial System Hardening and Configuration

#### Kernel Configuration

A custom-built kernel is one of Gentoo's strengths for optimization and security.

1. **Review your kernel configuration (`.config` in your kernel source directory):**

      * **Disable unnecessary drivers and features:** Every enabled feature in the kernel increases the attack surface and memory footprint. Carefully review modules related to hardware you do not possess or functionality you will not use (e.g., exotic filesystems, network protocols, obscure hardware support).
      * **Enable essential security features:**
          * `CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM` and `CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX`: Restrict direct memory access and kernel read/write/execute permissions.
          * `CONFIG_HARDENED_USERCOPY`: Protects against `usercopy` exploitation.
          * `CONFIG_SLAB_FREELIST_HARDENED`: Hardens slab freelist for memory allocator security.
          * `CONFIG_STACKPROTECTOR_STRONG`: Enhances stack overflow protection.
          * `CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE` (KASLR): Randomizes kernel memory layout to make exploits harder.
          * `CONFIG_MODULE_SIG` and `CONFIG_MODULE_COMPRESS_ZSTD` (or `GZIP`, `LZ4`): If you intend to use signed kernel modules for enhanced security.
          * `CONFIG_AUDIT` and `CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL`: For system call auditing, useful for security monitoring.
          * `CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL`: For eBPF functionality, which is increasingly used for networking and security tooling.
          * **For gaming and low-latency audio, consider:**
              * `CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT`: If you are building a real-time kernel for music production, although a generic low-latency kernel is usually sufficient for most users.
              * `CONFIG_HZ_1000` (or appropriate HZ value): Higher timer frequency can improve responsiveness for interactive applications.
              * Appropriate I/O scheduler: For SSDs, `mq-deadline` or `none` (NOOP) is often optimal. For HDDs, `deadline` or `CFQ` (if available and not replaced by `BFQ` in newer kernels). You can set this per-device at runtime:

                ```bash
                echo deadline > /sys/block/sda/queue/scheduler
                ```

                To make it persistent, add `elevator=deadline` to your kernel boot parameters in GRUB/systemd-boot.

2. **Regular Kernel Updates:** Gentoo's rolling release model means new kernels are readily available. Keep your kernel updated to benefit from security patches and performance improvements.

      * `emerge --ask @world` will typically include new kernel sources.
      * After updating sources: `cd /usr/src/linux && make oldconfig && make -j$(nproc) && make modules_install && make install` followed by updating your bootloader. `genkernel all` is an option for automated kernel builds, but for precise control, manual configuration is preferred.

#### Portage Configuration (`/etc/portage`)

1. **`make.conf`:**

      * **`CFLAGS`/`CXXFLAGS`:** For development, optimization flags should be balanced with debugging capabilities. A good starting point might be `-O2 -pipe -march=native`. Avoid overly aggressive optimizations like `-Ofast` which can break compliance with standards.
      * **`CHOST`:** Ensure this is correctly set for your architecture (e.g., `x86_64-pc-linux-gnu`).
      * **`MAKEOPTS`:** Set to `MAKEOPTS="-j$(nproc)"` or `MAKEOPTS="-j$(($(nproc)+1))"` for parallel compilation. This significantly speeds up package builds.
      * **`FEATURES`:** Consider `ccache` for faster recompilations (`FEATURES="ccache"`) and `split-debug` if you need debug symbols in separate files.
      * **`L10N`:** Set your desired localization for appropriate language support.
      * **`INPUT_DEVICES` and `VIDEO_CARDS`:** While not directly GUI packages, these influence the base system's ability to interact with hardware. You'll refine these when you install the GUI, but ensure basic support for your input and video hardware is present.

2. **`package.use` (or `package.use/yourfile`):** This is where you fine-tune USE flags on a per-package basis, overriding global `USE` flags in `make.conf`. This is crucial for your diverse workload.

      * **Development Languages:**

          * **Python:** The default `python` USE flag is typically sufficient. However, for specific frameworks, you might need additional flags. For example, if you plan to use `PyQt` or `PyGTK` for GUI development (even if you primarily use IDEs), ensure relevant GUI USE flags are enabled for Python.

            ```text
            dev-lang/python qt5
            dev-lang/python gtk
            ```

          * **Rust:** Rust generally does not have many specific USE flags for its core compiler (`sys-devel/rust`). Cargo handles most dependencies. Ensure `llvm` and `clang` are available, as Rust heavily relies on them.
          * **Java:** The `java` USE flag will be essential for `dev-java/jdk` and `dev-java/jre`. You'll likely want `headless-awt` if you use Java for backend processes. For IDEs like JetBrains, `awt` and `xft` will be important later.

            ```text
            dev-java/jdk -headless-awt awt
            ```

          * **JavaScript (Node.js):** `nodejs` will be the primary package. Ensure `npm` (Node Package Manager) is functional. No specific USE flags usually.
          * **C/C++:** `sys-devel/gcc`, `sys-devel/gdb`, `dev-util/cmake`, `dev-util/ninja` are fundamental. Ensure `fortran` if you need it.

            ```text
            sys-devel/gcc fortran
            ```

          * **Perl/Lua:** `dev-lang/perl` and `dev-lang/lua`. No specific USE flags typically required for general use, though specific modules might have them.

      * **Cloud Development (GCP, AWS, Azure CLIs):**

          * Most cloud CLIs are Python or Go-based. Ensure `python` and `go` USE flags are globally enabled or per-package.
          * Specific packages:
              * `app-admin/aws-cli`
              * `app-admin/google-cloud-sdk` (check for specific USE flags, sometimes `python` or `curl` related)
              * `app-admin/azure-cli` (often Python-based, ensure `python` is enabled)

      * **AI/LLM Development:** This area is rapidly evolving.

          * **CUDA/ROCm:** If your hardware supports NVIDIA CUDA or AMD ROCm for GPU acceleration, enable the `cuda` or `rocm` USE flags for relevant packages like `dev-python/tensorflow`, `dev-python/pytorch`, `sci-libs/openblas`, `sci-libs/lapack`. This is critical for performance.

            ```text
            sci-libs/tensorflow cuda
            sci-libs/pytorch cuda
            ```

          * **OpenBLAS/LAPACK:** Ensure these are optimized for your CPU (e.g., `openblas` USE flag for `dev-python/numpy`, `dev-python/scipy`).
          * **Python `numpy`/`scipy`:** Crucial for AI. Ensure they are built with optimized BLAS/LAPACK backends.
          * **`onnx`:** If you plan to use ONNX runtime.
          * **Containerization (`docker`, `podman`):** Essential for many AI/ML workflows to manage environments and dependencies.

            ```text
            app-containers/docker btrfs # if using btrfs for storage
            app-containers/podman
            ```

      * **Gaming:**

          * **`abi_x86_32`:** This USE flag is critical for 32-bit compatibility on 64-bit systems, which is essential for many games, WINE, and Steam. Enable this globally in `make.conf` or for packages like `wine`, `steam`, and `mesa`.

            ```text
            # In /etc/portage/make.conf
            ABI_X86="32 64"
            ```

            If not set globally, you'll need to set it for numerous packages in `package.use`.
          * **`vulkan`:** Essential for modern gaming with Proton and DXVK. Enable this globally if possible, or for your graphics driver and `mesa`.
          * **`llvm`:** Important for graphics drivers and WINE/Proton.
          * **`opencl`:** Some games/applications may benefit.
          * **`udev`:** Critical for proper hardware detection, especially for joysticks, gamepads, etc.
          * **`alsa` and `pulseaudio` (or `pipewire`):** For sound. `pipewire` is the modern choice.

            ```text
            media-libs/pipewire bluetooth alsa jack pulseaudio
            ```

          * **`media-libs/mesa`:** Ensure you have the `vulkan` and your `video_cards` USE flags enabled.
          * **`games-util/steam-launcher`:** The Steam client.
          * **`app-emulation/wine`:** The Windows compatibility layer. Ensure `abi_x86_32`, `vulkan`, `fontconfig`, `gstreamer`, `mono`, `gecko` are enabled.

      * **Music Production:**

          * **`alsa` and `jack`:** ALSA is the fundamental Linux audio system, JACK is crucial for low-latency professional audio.

            ```text
            media-sound/jack dbus
            ```

          * **`midi`:** Many audio packages will have a `midi` USE flag to enable MIDI input/output.
          * **`pulseaudio` or `pipewire`:** For general desktop audio and bridging with JACK. `pipewire` is recommended for its versatility.
          * **`ladspa`, `lv2`, `vst`:** For audio plugins. Enable for relevant audio software.

            ```text
            media-sound/ardour jack lv2 vst
            ```

          * **`portaudio`, `portmidi`:** Cross-platform audio/MIDI libraries.
          * **`app-laptop/alsa-tools`, `app-laptop/alsa-utils`:** For ALSA control.
          * **`media-sound/qjackctl`:** A GUI for JACK, useful for managing audio connections.
          * **`media-sound/ardour` or `media-sound/reaper`:** Digital Audio Workstations (DAW).
          * **`media-sound/guitarix` or `media-sound/calf`:** Guitar amp simulation and effects.

      * **General System/Utility Packages (Pre-GUI):**

          * **`sys-apps/mlocate`:** For `locate` command (requires `updatedb` cron job).
          * **`sys-process/htop`:** Enhanced process viewer.
          * **`app-editors/vim` or `app-editors/neovim`:** Essential text editors.
          * **`net-misc/dhcpcd` or `net-misc/networkmanager`:** For network configuration (NetworkManager is good if you'll use a desktop environment).
          * **`sys-fs/dosfstools`, `sys-fs/ntfs3g`:** For interacting with FAT/NTFS filesystems.
          * **`sys-block/parted`, `sys-block/gparted` (GUI, later):** Disk partitioning tools.
          * **`sys-apps/pciutils` (`lspci`), `sys-apps/usbutils` (`lsusb`):** For hardware information.
          * **`app-misc/tmux` or `app-misc/screen`:** Terminal multiplexers for managing multiple shell sessions.
          * **`app-arch/zip`, `app-arch/unzip`, `app-arch/tar`:** Archiving tools.
          * **`net-misc/curl`, `net-misc/wget`:** Command-line download tools.
          * **`sys-apps/gentoo-sources`:** Ensure you have your kernel sources.
          * **`sys-kernel/linux-firmware`:** Essential for many devices, especially Wi-Fi.

    media-sound/calf jack lv2
    ```

#### System Services (OpenRC)

Review and configure your OpenRC services (`/etc/init.d/` and `/etc/conf.d/`).

1. **Network Configuration:**

      * If using `dhcpcd`: `rc-update add dhcpcd default`
      * If using `NetworkManager`: `rc-update add NetworkManager default` (if you chose `networkmanager` USE flag for `sys-apps/dbus` and `net-misc/networkmanager`).
      * Ensure networking is up and running: `ifconfig` or `ip a` to check. `ping google.com` to test connectivity.

2. **`sshd`:** Essential for remote administration.

      * `rc-update add sshd default`
      * **Secure `sshd` configuration (`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`):**
          * `PermitRootLogin no`: Highly recommended. Use `su -` or `sudo` for root privileges.
          * `PasswordAuthentication no`: Use SSH keys only (more secure).
          * `ChallengeResponseAuthentication no`
          * `UsePAM yes`
          * `AllowUsers yourusername` or `AllowGroups sshusers` (create this group).
          * Consider changing the default SSH port (`Port 22`).
          * Restart `sshd` after changes: `/etc/init.d/sshd restart`.

3. **`chronyd` or `ntpd`:** For time synchronization. Crucial for secure systems (e.g., certificates).

      * `rc-update add chronyd default` (recommended over ntpd for modern systems)

4. **`syslog-ng` or `rsyslog`:** For logging.

      * `rc-update add syslog-ng default` (or rsyslog)
      * Ensure logs are regularly rotated (`logrotate`).

5. **`acct` (optional but recommended):** For process accounting.

      * `rc-update add acct default`

6. **`cron` (`cronie` or `vixie-cron`):** For scheduled tasks (e.g., `updatedb` for `mlocate`, log rotation).

      * `rc-update add cronie default`

#### User Management and Permissions

1. **Create your primary user account:**

    ```bash
    useradd -m -G users,wheel,audio,video,cdrom,portage,usb,vboxusers,input,render,lp,disk,kvm,docker,libvirt,realtime -s /bin/bash yourusername
    passwd yourusername
    ```

    Adjust groups as needed. `wheel` for `sudo`, `audio` for sound, `video` and `render` for graphics, `input` for input devices, `docker` for Docker access, `realtime` for low-latency audio.
2. **Configure `sudo` (`/etc/sudoers`):** Use `visudo` to edit this file.
      * Add your user to the `sudo` group or grant specific commands.
      * `%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL` is common, allowing users in the `wheel` group to run any command as root.
3. **Review default umask:** Ensure appropriate default permissions for new files (e.g., `0022` in `/etc/bash/bashrc` or `/etc/profile`).

#### Security Tools

1. **Firewall (`net-firewall/iptables` or `net-firewall/nftables`):**

      * `emerge --ask net-firewall/iptables`
      * Create a basic firewall script to allow established connections, SSH, and block others.
      * Example (very basic, save as `/etc/conf.d/iptables` and configure `iptables` init script):

        ```text
        # Allow loopback
        -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
        -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT

        # Allow established and related connections
        -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
        -A OUTPUT -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

        # Allow SSH
        -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

        # Drop everything else by default
        -P INPUT DROP
        -P FORWARD DROP
        -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
        ```

      * `rc-update add iptables default`
      * For `nftables`, the configuration is different, but the principle is the same. `emerge --ask net-firewall/nftables`.

2. **`app-admin/logcheck` (optional):** Monitors logs for suspicious entries.

3. **`app-admin/aide` (optional):** Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment. Creates a database of file states and reports changes.

#### Portage Maintenance

1. **Update your Portage tree regularly:**
      * `emerge --sync` or `emaint sync --auto`
2. **Keep your system updated:**
      * `emerge --ask --verbose --update --deep --newuse @world`
      * `emerge --depclean` (remove orphaned packages)
      * `revdep-rebuild` (rebuild packages with broken dependencies)
      * `dispatch-conf` or `etc-update` (manage configuration file updates)

#### Initial Package Installation (Command Line)

Based on your requirements, here's an initial set of packages to install on your minimal system before the GUI:

```bash
# Update Portage tree
emerge --sync

# Essential utilities
emerge --ask sys-apps/mlocate sys-process/htop app-editors/vim app-misc/tmux sys-apps/pciutils sys-apps/usbutils net-misc/curl net-misc/wget app-arch/zip app-arch/unzip

# Networking
emerge --ask net-misc/networkmanager # If you prefer NetworkManager, otherwise dhcpcd is usually sufficient

# Development tools (core)
emerge --ask sys-devel/gcc sys-devel/gdb dev-util/cmake dev-util/ninja
emerge --ask dev-lang/python dev-lang/rust dev-lang/go dev-lang/java dev-lang/nodejs dev-lang/perl dev-lang/lua

# Cloud CLIs (these are often installed via their own scripts or pip, but some are in Portage)
emerge --ask app-admin/aws-cli app-admin/google-cloud-sdk app-admin/azure-cli

# Gaming dependencies (before Steam/Wine themselves)
# Ensure ABI_X86="32 64" is in make.conf or equivalent package.use entries exist for 32-bit support
emerge --ask media-libs/mesa-demos # for glxinfo/vkcube to test graphics
emerge --ask media-libs/vulkan-loader media-libs/vulkan-headers

# Audio (base)
emerge --ask media-sound/alsa-utils media-sound/jack media-libs/pipewire

# Set a suitable kernel source symlink
eselect kernel set 1 # Or the number corresponding to your installed kernel sources

# Rebuild world after major USE flag changes (like ABI_X86 or adding many USE flags)
# This will be a long process, consider running it in a tmux session
emerge --ask --verbose --update --deep --newuse @world
revdep-rebuild

# Manage configuration files
etc-update
```

### Moving Forward to GUI

Once you have confirmed this command-line environment is stable, secure, and functioning as expected for your development and administrative tasks, you can then proceed to install a GUI. Given your 30 years of experience, you are aware that a GUI brings a significant increase in complexity and attack surface.

**Considerations for GUI:**

* **Desktop Environment vs. Window Manager:**

  * **Desktop Environments (GNOME, KDE Plasma, XFCE):** Offer a complete, integrated experience with many pre-configured applications, but are heavier. KDE Plasma is feature-rich, GNOME is simpler but opinionated, XFCE is lightweight.
  * **Window Managers (i3, sway):** Offer maximum control, minimal resource usage, and are highly customizable. i3 is for X11, sway for Wayland. These require more manual configuration for a complete desktop experience. Given your preference for command-line efficiency, a tiling window manager like i3 (X11) or sway (Wayland) might align well with your workflow.

* **X11 vs. Wayland:**

  * **Wayland:** The modern display server protocol. Offers better security (isolation), tearing prevention, and is generally more efficient. Still maturing, and some applications (especially older ones or those relying on X11-specific features) may have issues or run via XWayland. This is the future.
  * **X11:** The traditional display server. Broad compatibility but with inherent security limitations.

I recommend you start with a minimal window manager like `i3` with `X11` to ensure basic graphical functionality, and then explore `sway` if you prefer Wayland.

This comprehensive approach should provide you with a solid, secure, and performant Gentoo base system. Remember, Gentoo's strength lies in its configurability; take your time to understand each component and its impact.

## Model: 2.5 Pro (reasoning)

It's good to see someone with a solid background returning to Gentoo. You're right to feel that way; the core principles of Portage that made it so powerful 20 years ago are still its greatest strength today. The landscape has certainly changed, but the control it offers remains unparalleled.

Given your use cases, a methodical approach to your USE flags and package selection will pay significant dividends. Let's build a task list to get your system ready for a graphical environment.

-----

### 1. Initial System Configuration and `make.conf`

Before you `emerge` a single package, let's tune `/etc/portage/make.conf`. This is the foundation of your entire system. A well-configured `make.conf` saves countless hours of recompiling down the line.

```bash
# /etc/portage/make.conf

# Compiler flags. -O2 is the safe, recommended default. 
# -march=native optimizes for your specific CPU architecture.
COMMON_FLAGS="-march=native -O2 -pipe"
CFLAGS="${COMMON_FLAGS}"
CXXFLAGS="${COMMON_FLAGS}"

# Set your build jobs. A good rule of thumb is number of CPU cores + 1.
# If you have an 8-core CPU, use:
MAKEOPTS="-j9"

# Set your video card(s). This is critical for everything from the GUI to AI and gaming.
# For NVIDIA:
VIDEO_CARDS="nvidia"
# For AMD:
# VIDEO_CARDS="amdgpu"
# For Intel:
# VIDEO_CARDS="intel"

# Define default USE flags. This is a starting point based on your needs.
# pipewire is the modern standard for audio.
# systemd is the default, but if you opted for OpenRC, adjust accordingly.
# vulkan is essential for modern gaming.
USE="systemd pipewire vulkan X"

# Accept common licenses to avoid interactive prompts.
ACCEPT_LICENSE="* -@EULA"

# Default to the system's Python 3 target
PYTHON_TARGETS="python3_11"
PYTHON_SINGLE_TARGET="python3_11"

# Enable multilib for 32-bit compatibility (essential for Steam/Wine)
ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64" # If you're comfortable on the testing branch for a desktop.
                        # Otherwise, manage this per-package in /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
```

**Administrative Tasks:**

1. **Sync Portage:** Use the new standard tool, `emaint`.

    ```bash
    emaint sync -a
    ```

2. **Install Sudo/Doas:** A base system doesn't include `sudo`.

    ```bash
    emerge --ask app-admin/sudo
    ```

    Then, configure it by running `visudo` and adding your user to the `wheel` group or a `sudoers` entry.
3. **Basic Utilities:** You'll want some familiar tools.

    ```bash
    emerge --ask app-editors/vim app-misc/screen sys-process/htop net-misc/wget dev-vcs/git
    ```

-----

### 2. Core Development and Cloud Environment

This covers your primary use case. We'll install the toolchains and cloud SDKs. Many of these benefit from specific `USE` flags, which we'll manage in `/etc/portage/package.use/`.

**Packages to Install:**

```bash
# Core toolchain
emerge --ask sys-devel/gcc sys-devel/clang sys-devel/make dev-util/cmake

# Languages
emerge --ask dev-lang/python dev-lang/rust dev-java/openjdk-bin net-libs/nodejs

# Containerization (choose one)
emerge --ask app-emulation/docker
# or
emerge --ask app-emulation/podman

# Cloud SDKs
emerge --ask app-emulation/google-cloud-sdk dev-python/awscli dev-util/azure-cli
```

**Configuration (`package.use`):**

It's cleaner to manage `USE` flags for specific packages or categories in `/etc/portage/package.use/`. Create a file, for example, `/etc/portage/package.use/dev`, and add the following:

```text
# /etc/portage/package.use/dev

# Add ncurses support for vim
app-editors/vim ncurses

# Enable multiple python versions for tools that need them
dev-python/pylint python_targets_python3_11
```

After installing Docker, add your user to the `docker` group to manage it without `sudo`.

```bash
gpasswd -a ${USER} docker
```

-----

### 3. AI/LLM and GPU Compute

This is where Gentoo's fine-grained control shines. You need to enable the correct compute backends. This assumes you've set `VIDEO_CARDS` in `make.conf`.

**Key `USE` Flags:**

* **NVIDIA:** You will need the `cuda` flag.
* **AMD:** You will need the `rocm` flag.

These flags should be enabled for any package that will leverage the GPU, such as `tensorflow` or `pytorch`.

**Configuration (`package.use`):**

Create a file `/etc/portage/package.use/ai-ml`:

```text
# For NVIDIA
sci-libs/tensorflow cuda
sci-libs/pytorch cuda

# For AMD
# sci-libs/tensorflow rocm
# sci-libs/pytorch rocm
```

**Packages to Install:**

The core libraries are often best installed via `pip` into a virtual environment to manage complex dependencies, but you need the system-level drivers and toolkits from Portage.

1. **Install the drivers and toolkits:** By setting `VIDEO_CARDS` and the appropriate `USE` flags, Portage will pull in the necessary `nvidia-drivers`, `cuda-toolkit`, or `rocm-hip-sdk` when you install a dependent package. For now, we can prepare the system by emerging a core component like `mesa` with the right flags.

    ```bash
    emerge --ask --changed-use media-libs/mesa
    ```

2. **Install Python ML libraries:**
      * First, create a Python virtual environment: `python -m venv ~/llm_env`
      * Activate it: `source ~/llm_env/bin/activate`
      * Install your libraries: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio tensorflow`
      * The Google Gemini CLI is also a `pip` install: `pip install google-generativeai`

### 4. Gaming and Music Production

These have specific, and sometimes conflicting, requirements. Gaming requires a robust 32-bit environment, and professional audio requires a real-time kernel.

**Gaming Setup:**

1. **Enable Multilib:** If you didn't set `ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64"`, you'll need to enable 32-bit support by editing `/etc/portage/make.conf` and adding `abi_x86_32` to your `USE` flags for key packages. However, the easiest path is to enable the multilib profile.

    ```bash
    eselect profile set default/linux/amd64/17.1/desktop # or plasma, etc.
    ```

    After changing your profile, you must re-emerge the whole system:

    ```bash
    emerge --ask --update --deep --newuse @world
    ```

2. **Enable Vulkan:** The `vulkan` `USE` flag in `make.conf` is a good start.
3. **Install Gaming Packages:**

    ```bash
    # Steam requires multilib.
    emerge --ask games-util/steam-launcher app-emulation/wine app-emulation/gamemode
    ```

**Music Production Setup:**

1. **Real-time Kernel:** For low-latency audio, a real-time kernel is non-negotiable.

      * Install the Gentoo sources: `emerge --ask sys-kernel/gentoo-sources`
      * When configuring your kernel (`make menuconfig`), you must enable the fully preemptible kernel: `Processor type and features` -\> `Preemption Model` -\> `Fully Preemptible Kernel (Real-Time)`.
      * Compile and install your new kernel.

2. **Real-time Permissions:** Install `realtime-base` and add your user to the `realtime` group.

    ```bash
    emerge --ask sys-auth/realtime-base
    gpasswd -a ${USER} realtime
    ```

3. **Audio Server & `USE` Flags:**

      * `pipewire` is the modern choice and provides compatibility layers for JACK and PulseAudio.
      * Your `USE="pipewire"` in `make.conf` handles much of this.
      * For pro-audio apps, ensure the `jack` USE flag is enabled.

    **Configuration (`package.use/audio`):**

    ```text
    # Ensure pro-audio apps can use the JACK server (or Pipewire's JACK layer)
    media-sound/ardour jack
    media-sound/audacity jack
    ```

4. **Install Audio Software:**

    ```bash
    # Emerge PipeWire and its session manager, WirePlumber
    emerge --ask media-video/pipewire media-sound/wireplumber

    # Emerge your DAWs and tools
    emerge --ask media-sound/ardour media-sound/audacity media-sound/jack2
    ```

This sequence should give you a robust, highly-tuned base system. Once this is done and you've rebooted into your new kernel, you'll be in an excellent position to emerge a desktop environment like KDE (`kde-plasma/plasma-meta`) or a simple window manager. Read the `emerge` output carefully—it provides a wealth of information.

Welcome back to the fold.
