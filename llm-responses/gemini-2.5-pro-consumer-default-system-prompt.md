Of course. It's smart to build up a solid, secure command-line foundation before adding the complexity of a GUI. Given your experience and goals, here's a task list to guide your next steps with your new Gentoo system.

-----

### 1\. Configure for the Testing Branch

Since you want to be on the "bleeding edge," you need to tell Portage to use the testing branch (`~amd64`) for most packages.

1.  **Edit `make.conf`**: Open `/etc/portage/make.conf` and add the following line. This tells Portage to consider the testing version of packages for your architecture.

    ```bash
    ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64"
    ```

2.  **Update Your System**: After saving the file, you should sync the repository and run a full world update to pull in the testing versions of packages you already have installed.

    ```bash
    emerge --sync
    emerge --update --deep --newuse @world
    ```

    Pay close attention to the output here, as this will likely be a large update.

-----

### 2\. Install Essential System & Admin Tools

Your base system is minimal. Let's add some core utilities for system management and ease of use.

  * **Sudo**: Install `sudo` for privileged command execution without logging in as root.

    ```bash
    emerge --ask app-admin/sudo
    ```

    After installation, run `visudo` and add your user account (e.g., `your_user ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL`).

  * **Portage Helpers**: These tools make managing a Gentoo system much easier. `gentoolkit` provides tools like `revdep-rebuild` (to fix broken reverse dependencies) and `equery`. `eix` offers a much faster way to search for packages.

    ```bash
    emerge --ask app-portage/gentoolkit app-portage/eix
    # Run this once after installing eix to build its cache
    eix-update
    ```

  * **A Good Terminal Editor**: You'll be editing a lot of text files. `nano` is likely already there, but `vim` or `neovim` are powerful alternatives.

    ```bash
    # Choose one
    emerge --ask app-editors/vim
    emerge --ask app-editors/neovim
    ```

  * **Shell Enhancements**: Install `app-shells/bash-completion` for tab-completion of commands and their arguments. The `sys-apps/mlocate` package is also useful for quickly finding files (`updatedb` followed by `locate <filename>`).

-----

### 3\. Basic Security Hardening

Before connecting to the wider world for development, it's wise to set up a firewall and other security tools.

  * **Firewall**: `nftables` is the modern Linux firewall framework.

    ```bash
    emerge --ask net-firewall/nftables
    ```

    You'll need to create a configuration file at `/etc/nftables.conf`. A good starting point is a simple "deny all incoming, allow all outgoing" ruleset. The Gentoo Wiki has excellent examples. Once configured, you can enable and start the `systemd` service:

    ```bash
    systemctl enable nftables.service
    systemctl start nftables.service
    ```

  * **Intrusion Prevention**: `fail2ban` is a classic tool that scans log files for malicious activity (like repeated failed SSH logins) and bans the offending IP addresses.

    ```bash
    emerge --ask sys-apps/fail2ban
    ```

  * **SSH**: Review your `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file. It's good practice to disable root login (`PermitRootLogin no`) and password-based authentication (`PasswordAuthentication no`), relying on SSH keys instead.

-----

### 4\. Set Up Your Development Environment

This is your highest priority, so we'll cover the core components.

  * **Version Control**: `git` is essential.

    ```bash
    emerge --ask dev-vcs/git
    ```

  * **Language Toolchains**: Emerge the necessary compilers and interpreters.

      * **Python**: Gentoo manages Python versions with `eselect python`. You can install multiple versions.
        ```bash
        emerge --ask dev-lang/python:3.12 dev-lang/python:3.11
        ```
      * **Rust**: While you can emerge `dev-lang/rust`, the recommended way to manage Rust toolchains is with `rustup`. You can install the `rustup` installer with `emerge dev-util/rustup` and then run `rustup-init` as your user.
      * **Java**: Similar to Python, Gentoo uses `eselect java-vm` to manage different JDKs. Install a version like OpenJDK.
        ```bash
        emerge --ask dev-java/openjdk-bin:21
        ```
      * **Node.js**:
        ```bash
        emerge --ask net-libs/nodejs
        ```
      * **C/C++**: The GCC toolchain (`sys-devel/gcc`) is already installed as part of the base system. You might also want `clang`.
        ```bash
        emerge --ask sys-devel/clang
        ```

  * **Cloud & Container Tools**:

      * **Docker/Podman**: `podman` is a daemonless alternative to Docker and is often simpler from a security perspective. Choose what you're more comfortable with.
        ```bash
        # For Docker
        emerge --ask app-emulation/docker
        # Add your user to the 'docker' group
        gpasswd -a your_user docker
        systemctl enable docker.service

        # Or for Podman
        emerge --ask app-emulation/podman
        ```
      * **Cloud CLIs**:
        ```bash
        emerge --ask app-emulation/google-cloud-sdk app-admin/aws-cli-v2
        ```

-----

### 5\. AI and LLM Tooling

This heavily relies on Python environments and potentially GPU acceleration.

  * **GPU Drivers and CUDA**: If you have an NVIDIA card, this is a critical and complex step. You'll need the proprietary drivers and the CUDA toolkit. **I highly recommend following the [Gentoo NVIDIA Guide](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/NVIDIA/nvidia-drivers) and the [CUDA Guide](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/CUDA) carefully.**
    ```bash
    # This is a simplified example, check the wiki!
    emerge --ask x11-drivers/nvidia-drivers sys-devel/cuda
    ```
  * **Python Virtual Environments**: For AI/ML work, **always** use virtual environments to manage dependencies. Python's built-in `venv` module is sufficient.
    ```bash
    # Create a project directory
    mkdir ~/my-llm-project && cd ~/my-llm-project
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv .venv
    # Activate it
    source .venv/bin/activate
    # Now install libraries with pip
    pip install torch tensorflow jax
    ```

### 6\. Gaming Setup

Your `desktop/systemd` profile should have enabled `multilib` (the `ABI_X86="64 32"` USE flag), which is required for Steam and most games. You can verify this in your `make.conf`.

  * **Steam**: Emerge the launcher.
    ```bash
    emerge --ask games-util/steam-launcher
    ```
  * **WINE**: Install `wine-staging` for a more feature-rich version of WINE.
    ```bash
    emerge --ask app-emulation/wine-staging
    ```
  * **Proton-GE**: GloriousEggroll's Proton builds are not in the official Gentoo repository. The easiest way to install and manage them is with a tool like `protonup-qt`. You can install it via pip or as a Flatpak later once you have a desktop environment. For now, you could clone the git repo and run it manually.
  * **Gaming Helpers**:
    ```bash
    emerge --ask games-util/gamemode games-util/mangohud
    ```

-----

### 7\. Music Production Setup ðŸŽ¹

Linux audio can be complex, but `PipeWire` has simplified it greatly. Your `desktop` profile may have already pulled it in.

  * **Enable the Pro-Audio Overlay**: The Gentoo community maintains an excellent overlay for professional audio software.
    ```bash
    emerge --ask eselect-repository
    eselect repository enable gentoo-pro-audio
    emerge --sync
    ```
  * **Core Audio System**: Install `PipeWire` (if not present) and `JACK` support. PipeWire can act as a backend for JACK applications.
    ```bash
    emerge --ask media-video/pipewire media-sound/jack2
    ```
  * **DAW and Instruments**: With the overlay enabled, you can install a Digital Audio Workstation and plugins.
    ```bash
    emerge --ask media-sound/ardour media-sound/audacity media-plugins/calf
    ```
  * **Native Instruments Hardware**: This is the trickiest part. Support is often unofficial and requires `wine-staging`. You'll need to research specific drivers and wrappers for your keyboard and drum machine models. The [Linux Musicians](https://linuxmusicians.com/) forum is an excellent resource for this.

Once you complete these steps, you'll have an incredibly capable, secure, and highly customized system ready for you to install your preferred desktop environment and window manager. Good luck with the build\! What are you thinking for your desktop environment?
