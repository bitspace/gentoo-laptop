Of course. It's good to see someone with a history in the field returning to Gentoo. Much has changed in 20 years, but the core philosophy of choice and control remains the same. Building a solid, secure base system before adding the complexity of a graphical environment is the correct and professional approach.

Given your experience and desire to be on the testing branch, we can move quickly. Here is a task list to get your system configured and ready for your specific workloads.

-----

## 1\. Configure Portage for the Testing Branch

Your first and most critical step is to configure Portage to use the testing branch (`~amd64`). The modern and most maintainable way to do this is not to set `ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64"` globally in `make.conf`, as that can be a bit too aggressive. Instead, we'll set it globally but use the `package.accept_keywords` mechanism to pin critical packages to stable if needed. This provides a safety net.

1.  **Edit `make.conf`**: Add the following line to `/etc/portage/make.conf`. This tells the system that your default preference is the testing branch.

    ```bash
    # /etc/portage/make.conf
    ACCEPT_KEYWORDS="~amd64"
    ```

2.  **Create the `package.accept_keywords` directory**: This is the best practice for managing exceptions.

    ```bash
    mkdir -p /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords
    ```

    If you ever find a `~amd64` package that is unstable (e.g., `sys-devel/gcc`), you can force it back to the stable version by creating a file in this directory. For example:

    ```bash
    # /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords/gcc
    sys-devel/gcc -~amd64
    ```

    For now, you can leave this directory empty.

3.  **Perform a full system update**: This will pull in all the `~amd64` versions of packages based on your new configuration.

    ```bash
    emerge --sync
    emerge --ask --verbose --update --deep --newuse @world
    ```

## 2\. Essential System Configuration (`make.conf`)

Your `/etc/portage/make.conf` file is the heart of your system's build configuration. Let's optimize it for your hardware and use cases.

```bash
# /etc/portage/make.conf

# Set compiler flags. -march=native optimizes for your specific CPU.
COMMON_FLAGS="-O2 -pipe -march=native"

# Set parallel jobs for emerge. A good rule is the number of CPU cores.
# Use 'nproc' to determine the core count automatically.
MAKEOPTS="-j$(nproc)"

# --- USE Flags ---
# This is a starting point based on your needs.
# You chose a systemd profile, so 'systemd' is implied.
# Add 'X' and 'wayland' now to prepare for the GUI.
# 'pipewire' is the modern standard for all audio.
# 'vulkan' is essential for modern gaming.
USE="X wayland vulkan pipewire pulseaudio-daemon jack alsa steam-runtime -bluetooth -gnome -kde"

# --- Hardware Specifics ---
# Set this to your graphics card. Common options: "nvidia", "amdgpu", "intel".
VIDEO_CARDS="amdgpu" # Or "nvidia", "intel"

# Modern input device driver
INPUT_DEVICES="libinput"

# --- Language Targets ---
# Control which versions of languages are targeted by packages.
PYTHON_TARGETS="python3_12"
LUA_TARGETS="lua5-4"
```

**Note:** Adjust `VIDEO_CARDS` and `PYTHON_TARGETS` as appropriate for your hardware and preferences. After modifying your `USE` flags, you must run an update again to apply the changes: `emerge --ask --verbose --update --deep --newuse @world`.

## 3\. Core Packages and Utilities

Before the big application installs, let's get some essential command-line tools and system administration packages.

  * **System Administration Toolkit**: `gentoolkit` is non-negotiable for managing a Gentoo system. `eix` is a far superior tool for searching the Portage tree.

    ```bash
    emerge --ask app-portage/gentoolkit app-portage/eix
    eix-update
    ```

    You will now have access to `equery`, `eclean`, `revdep-rebuild`, etc.

  * **Essential Utilities**:

    ```bash
    emerge --ask \
        app-editors/neovim          # Or vim, if you prefer
        sys-process/htop            # Better process monitor
        app-misc/tmux               # Terminal multiplexer
        net-misc/chrony             # Modern time synchronization daemon
        app-admin/sudo              # Privilege escalation
        sys-fs/e2fsprogs            # For ext4 filesystems
        sys-fs/dosfstools           # For FAT filesystems (EFI partition)
        net-misc/openssh            # For remote access
    ```

  * **Enable Core Services**: Since you are using `systemd`:

    ```bash
    systemctl enable chronyd.service
    systemctl start chronyd.service
    systemctl enable sshd.service
    ```

    Remember to configure `sudo` by running `visudo` and adding your user account.

## 4\. Software for Your Use Cases

Now we'll emerge the packages for your specific workflows.

  * **Software & Cloud Development**:

    ```bash
    emerge --ask \
        dev-vcs/git \
        dev-lang/python:3.12 \
        dev-lang/rust-bin \
        dev-java/openjdk-bin:17 \
        net-libs/nodejs \
        dev-util/cmake \
        dev-python/google-cloud-sdk \
        dev-python/awscli \
        app-emulation/docker # Or podman
    ```

    For C/C++, `sys-devel/gcc` is already installed as part of the system. You can also `emerge sys-devel/clang`.

  * **AI/LLM Development**: This is heavily tied to your GPU. If you have an NVIDIA card, you'll need the `cuda` USE flag. For AMD, `rocm`. These are complex and will pull in massive dependencies.

      * Enable the relevant USE flag (`cuda` or `rocm`) in `/etc/portage/package.use/` for specific packages.
      * Example for NVIDIA: `emerge --ask dev-python/pytorch-bin dev-python/tensorflow-bin`

  * **Gaming**: You'll want `steam-launcher`, Wine, and helper utilities.

    ```bash
    emerge --ask \
        games-util/steam-launcher \
        app-emulation/wine-staging \
        games-util/gamemode \
        games-util/protontricks
    ```

    For GloriousEggroll's Proton builds, you will likely install them manually or use a third-party script/tool like `protonup-qt` after you have a desktop environment. The `steam-launcher` package with the `steam-runtime` USE flag provides the necessary foundation.

  * **Music Production**: Your choice of `pipewire` in `make.conf` is the key first step. The `jack` USE flag on `media-video/pipewire` enables the JACK ABI, so legacy professional audio applications will work seamlessly. For low-latency audio, you may consider installing a realtime kernel later (`emerge --ask sys-kernel/realtime-kernel-sources`).

    ```bash
    emerge --ask media-sound/ardour media-sound/helvum
    ```

    Native Instruments hardware can be challenging. Support is often provided by the community. Once you have a graphical environment, you can investigate tools that might configure your specific hardware. There is no single package for this; it will require research.

## 5\. Initial Security Steps

A secure base is a good base.

1.  **Firewall**: `nftables` is the modern kernel firewall framework.
    ```bash
    emerge --ask net-firewall/nftables
    # A very basic configuration can be found at /etc/nftables.conf
    # You will need to create your own ruleset.
    systemctl enable nftables.service
    ```
2.  **SSH Hardening**: Edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` to improve security.
    ```
    PermitRootLogin no
    PasswordAuthentication no
    ```
    This assumes you have already set up SSH keys for your user, which is the proper way to manage remote access.

Once you have completed these steps, you will have a very robust, up-to-date Gentoo system tailored to your needs. The next logical step would be choosing and installing your desktop environment or window manager, which will build upon the `X`, `wayland`, and `vulkan` USE flags you've already set.
