# Gentoo Laptops

## Abstract

This documents the process and approach to installing Gentoo Linux on my laptops.  

It started with just the System76 Kudu, but as I started working with it, I fell into the old sense of comfort and control and wonder that I had 20 years ago when I last ran Gentoo.

## Approach

I think the best approach at this time is to work through this thoroughly on the Kudu laptop before I tackle the ThinkPad.  

I am going to also leverage various LLM's, initially by feeding them the same prompt, judging their output quality, and see where to go from there. Where possible I am going to set the model up as a Linux expert, probably using the same system prompt in each case. If I am so motivated, I might try different models in each LLM where that capability exists.

This will include hand-rolling a kernel. I intend to work with LLM for that too, with follow-up prompts after the initial dialogue.

Consideration: use one of the AI tools to help compare, distill, and analyze the output of all of the models to derive a "best of" approach. Do some verification/validation against web-based sources. My gut sense is that this may best be done with Claude Code.

**IDEA**: Ask the LLM to help plan this approach. "How would you do this?" and expand on it.
