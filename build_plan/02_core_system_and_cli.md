# 2. Core System and Flake Configuration

With the base system installed, we will now structure the configuration using **Nix Flakes**. This is the foundation for our declarative system. From this point on, all changes will be made by editing configuration files and running `nixos-rebuild switch`.

Log in as `root` at the TTY prompt.

### Step 2.1: Create the Flake Structure

1.  Navigate to your NixOS configuration directory:
    ```bash
    cd /etc/nixos/
    ```
2.  This directory should contain `configuration.nix` and `hardware-configuration.nix`. We are going to create a new `flake.nix` file.
3.  Enable git and make an initial commit to track our changes.
    ```bash
    # You may need to install git first
    nix-env -iA nixos.git
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial NixOS configuration"
    ```
4.  Create the `flake.nix` file:
    ```bash
    nano flake.nix
    ```
    Paste the following content into `flake.nix`:

    ```nix
    {
      description = "A declarative NixOS system for Gimli";

      inputs = {
        nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
        home-manager.url = "github:nix-community/home-manager";
        home-manager.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
      };

      outputs = { self, nixpkgs, home-manager, ... }@inputs: {
        nixosConfigurations.gimli = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
          system = "x86_64-linux";
          specialArgs = { inherit inputs; };
          modules = [
            ./configuration.nix
            home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager
            {
              home-manager.useGlobalPkgs = true;
              home-manager.useUserPackages = true;
              home-manager.extraSpecialArgs = { inherit inputs; };
            }
          ];
        };
      };
    }
    ```

### Step 2.2: Refactor `configuration.nix`

Now we need to adjust our main `configuration.nix` to work within the flake.

1.  Edit the configuration file:
    ```bash
    nano configuration.nix
    ```
2.  Ensure the file looks like this. Pay attention to the `imports` and the new user configuration block.

    ```nix
    { config, pkgs, ... }:

    {
      imports = [ ./hardware-configuration.nix ];

      # Bootloader
      boot.loader.systemd-boot.enable = true;
      boot.loader.efi.canTouchEfiVariables = true;

      # Networking
      networking.hostName = "gimli"; # Define your hostname.
      networking.networkmanager.enable = true;

      # Set your time zone.
      time.timeZone = "America/New_York"; # e.g. "Europe/Berlin"

      # Select internationalisation properties.
      i18n.defaultLocale = "en_US.UTF-8";

      # Configure keymap in X11
      services.xserver = {
        layout = "us";
        xkbVariant = "";
      };

      # Define a user account. Don't forget to set a password with `passwd`.
      users.users.chris = {
        isNormalUser = true;
        description = "Chris";
        extraGroups = [ "wheel" "networkmanager" ];
      };

      # Allow unfree packages
      nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true;

      # List packages installed in system profile.
      environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
        vim
        git
        wget
        curl
        htop
        # Add your Gemini CLI package here later
      ];

      # Enable the OpenSSH daemon.
      services.openssh.enable = true;

      # This value determines the NixOS release from which the default
      # settings for stateful data, like file locations and database versions
      # on your system were taken. Itâ€˜s perfectly fine and recommended to leave
      # this value at the release version of the first install of this system.
      # Before changing this value read the documentation for this option
      # (e.g. man configuration.nix or on https://nixos.org/nixos/options.html).
      system.stateVersion = "23.11"; # Or whatever version you installed.
    }
    ```

### Step 2.3: First Declarative Rebuild

Now we apply our new flake-based configuration for the first time.

1.  Run the rebuild command. Note that we are referencing the flake (`.#gimli`) in the current directory.
    ```bash
    nixos-rebuild switch --flake .#gimli
    ```
2.  This will download the new flake inputs (`home-manager`) and rebuild your system.
3.  After it succeeds, create your user's password:
    ```bash
    passwd chris
    ```
4.  Commit the changes:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Convert to flake and add user"
    ```

### Step 2.4: Gemini CLI Integration

At this point, you would add the Gemini CLI to your system. Assuming it's available as a Nix package (e.g., `pkgs.gemini-cli`), you would add it to the `environment.systemPackages` list in `configuration.nix` and rebuild.

If it's not packaged, you would create a Nix package for it, but for now, we will assume it can be added to the list.

**From now on, you should log in as `chris` and use `sudo` for commands that require root privileges.** The rest of this guide will assume you are operating as the `chris` user.
